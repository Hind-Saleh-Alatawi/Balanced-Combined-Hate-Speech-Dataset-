A combined dataset of three available datasets: 
1-Davidson-ICWSM (Davidson et al. 2017)
2-Waseem-EMNLP (Waseem 2016)
3- Waseem-NAACL (Waseem and Hovy 2016) 
to assess the model performance on the largest possible diverse dataset that is balanced according to the lowest class number
by randomly selecting a similar number of examples for each class and the number of classes specified according to the lowest class in the combined dataset. 
The dataset combining offers us a hugely diverse set of data to assess the deep model performance as it is known that deep models perform better on large training data.
